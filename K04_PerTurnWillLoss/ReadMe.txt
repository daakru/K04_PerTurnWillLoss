[WotC] Turn-Based Will Loss
Mod Author: Kinetos#6935
Version: 1.0

Replaces the Will Loss from discovering an enemy pod with a turn based Will Loss mechanic.
All code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/daakru/K04_PerTurnWillLoss).

Description:
------------
THIS MOD IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE WITH LONG WAR OF THE CHOSEN
I give no guarantees that doing so will not break the game.

Disables the default Pod Sighted Will Loss event, adding a turn-based Will Loss mechanic with a configurable turn frequency.
This is adapted from the Turn-Based Will Loss mechanic present in LWotC for use in the base version of WotC.

Requirements:
-------------
This mod edits the config of [XComGame.X2EventListener_DefaultWillEvents] and may conflict with other mods that do the same.

    and this page on the Modding Wiki (https://www.reddit.com/r/xcom2mods/wiki/index/dlcrunorder). 

Configuration:
--------------
XComPerTurnWillLoss.ini has configurable values for the Per-Turn Will Loss mechanic.
XComGameCore.ini disables the default Pod Reveal Will Loss event.

MoreWillRollEdits/XComGameCore.ini adds additional config edits from LWotC.
Feel free to comment out, delete, or change the name as described in the file to disable the additional changes.
